## 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order** and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example**

```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807. 
```



### Solution

**Intuition**

Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits sum starting from the head of list, which contains the least-significant digit.

**Algorithm**

Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of `l1` and `l2`. Since each digit is in the range of `0â€¦9`, summing two digits may contain "overflow". For example, `5+7=12`. In this case, 

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        """
        :type l1: ListNode
        :type l2: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        # check that linked lists l1 and l2 are not empty
        if not l1:
            return l2
        if not l2:
            return l1
        x1 = x2 = ''
        # extracting number x1 from linked list l1
        curr_node = l1
        while curr_node:
            x1 += str(curr_node.val)
            curr_node = curr_node.next
        # extracting number x2 from linked list l2            
        curr_node = l2
        while curr_node:
            x2 += str(curr_node.val)
            curr_node = curr_node.next
        # Add Two Numbers: y = x1 + x2
        y = int(x1[::-1]) + int(x2[::-1])
        y = str(y)[::-1]
        # make result 
        head = new_node = ListNode(y[0])
        for i in range(1, len(y)):
            new_node.next = ListNode(y[i])
            new_node = new_node.next
        return head
				```
```
