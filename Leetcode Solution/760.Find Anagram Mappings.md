## 760. Find Anagram Mappings

Given two lists `A`and `B`, and `B` is an anagram of `A`. `B` is an anagram of `A` means `B` is made by randomizing the order of the elements in `A`.

We want to find an *index mapping* `P`, from `A` to `B`. A mapping `P[i] = j` means the `i`th element in `A`appears in `B` at index `j`.

These lists `A` and `B` may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.

**Example:** 

given:

```
A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]
B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]
```

we should return:

```
[1, 4, 3, 2, 0]
```

as `P[0] = 1` because the `0`th element of `A` appears at `B[1]`, and `P[1] = 4` because the `1`st element of `A` appears at `B[4]`, and so on.

**Note:**

1. `A, B` have equal lengths in range `[1, 100]`.
2. `A[i], B[i]` are integers in range `[0, 10^5]`.





The first method I can think of is this:

```python
class Solution:
    def anagramMappings(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :type B: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        p = []
        for idx in range(len(A)):
            p.append([index for index in range(len(B)) if (B[index] == A[idx])][0])
        return p
```



### Approach #1. Hash Table

**Intuition**

Take the example `A = [12, 28, 46]`, `B = [46, 12, 28]`. We want to know where the `12` occurs in `B`, say at position `1`; then where the `28` occurs in `B`, which is position `2`; then where the `46` occurs in `B`, which is position `0`.

If we had a dictionary (hash table) `D = {46: 0, 12: 1, 28: 2}`, then this question could be handled easily.

**Algorithm**

Create the hash table `D` as described above. Then, the answer is a list of `D[A[i]]` for `i = 0, 1, ...`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def anagramMappings(self, A, B):
        D = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(B)}
        return [D[x] for x in A]
```

- **Complexity Analysis**
  - Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of A.
  - Space Complexity: O(N).



And this the solution that takes shortest time(actually it is similiar as the above):

```python
class Solution:
    def anagramMappings(self, A, B):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :type B: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        
        d = {}
        for i, b in enumerate(B):
            if b not in d: d[b] = []
            d[b].append(i)
        
        return [d[a].pop() for a in A]
```





### Addtional Note: *enumerate()* function

**`enumerate`(*iterable*, *start=0*)**

Return an enumerate object. *iterable* must be a sequence, an [iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterator), or some other object which supports iteration. The [`__next__()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator.__next__) method of the iterator returned by [`enumerate()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate)returns a tuple containing a count (from *start* which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over *iterable*.

\>>>

```
>>> seasons = ['Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall', 'Winter']
>>> list(enumerate(seasons))
[(0, 'Spring'), (1, 'Summer'), (2, 'Fall'), (3, 'Winter')]
>>> list(enumerate(seasons, start=1))
[(1, 'Spring'), (2, 'Summer'), (3, 'Fall'), (4, 'Winter')]
```

Equivalent to:

```python
def enumerate(sequence, start=0):
    n = start
    for elem in sequence:
        yield n, elem
        n += 1
```
