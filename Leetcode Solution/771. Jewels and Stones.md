## 771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings *J* representing the types of stones that are jewels, and *S* representing the stones you have.  Each character in *S* is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in *J* are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in *J* and *S* are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

**Example 1:**

```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```
**Note:**

    S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
    The characters in J are distinct.


The first method I can think of is to direct search it one by one.

```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        count = 0
        for item_s in S:
            for item_j in J:
                if (item_j == item_s):
                    count += 1   
        return count        
        
        """
        :type J: str
        :type S: str
        :rtype: int
        """
```



### Approach #1. Brute Force

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        return sum(s in J for s in S)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(len(J) * len(S))
- Space Complexity:  O(1) additional space complexity in Python



### Approach #2. Hash Set

For each stone, check whether it matches any of the jewels. We can check efficiently with a *Hash Set*.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        Jset = set(J)
        return sum(s in Jset for s in S)
```

**Complexity Analysis**

- Time Complexity: O(len(J) + len(S)), the O(len(J)) comes from creating J, while the O(len(S)) comes from searching S.
- Space Complexity:  O(len(J))
