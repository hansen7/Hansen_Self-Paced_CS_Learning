## File Statement

- *linrer.py* & *linreg_dataset.py* is the example provided from lectures, using linear regression under TensorFlow
- *linreg_starter.py* & *my_notepad.py* are my own trial on this method, and some of these programs produce tensorflow graphs in the *graphs* folder
- *utils.py* basically provides functions on data reading and preprocessing
- *variable_sharing.py* seems to define a two-layer fully connected network with TensorFlow
- *word2vec_utils.py* basically provides functions to proposssing the training set.
- other *word2vec_\*.py* are similiar as the *linreg_\** files.
