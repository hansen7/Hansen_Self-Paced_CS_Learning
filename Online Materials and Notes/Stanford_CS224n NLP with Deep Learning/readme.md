Dear readers:

    I write the code assignments in Python3.6 syntax, it takes me a lot of time to adjust the original code(in Python2.7), and it is not common to find similar scripts from other online sites. And I also write the coding results into .log file each time in order to revise them in the future. 
    So if you like it, don't forget to fork or star my work.

Best, Hansen





For the first part of the lecture content, is about using vectors to describe the words, I used Ch.15&16 in the *Speech and Language Processing*  as a reference to get better understanding.
