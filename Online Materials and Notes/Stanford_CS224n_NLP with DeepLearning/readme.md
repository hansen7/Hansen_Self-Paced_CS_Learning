Dear readers:

    I write the code assignments in Python3.6 syntax, it takes me a lot of time to adjust the original code(in Python2.7), and it is not common to find similar scripts from other online sites. And I also write the coding results into .log file each time in order to revise them in the future. 
    So if you like it, don't forget to fork or star my work.

Best, Hansen
