— This is a place that I use as a record for my cs learning trip :) and I will list the resources that I used for Python and Machine Learning here.



### Textbooks List

**For Basic Python Syntax:**



**For Machine Learning:**

- *机器学习，* [周志华](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/)著，这本书基础概念非常清晰，非常适合初学者，课后习题对于理解概念非常有效，但没有代码可供学习。
- *The Element of Statistical Learning,* by T. Hastie et al., advanced textbook
- *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning,* by C.M. Bishop, advanced textbook


**For Natural Language Processing:**

- Oxford [Deep NLP](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017)
- [*Speech and Language Processing*](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/), by Daniel Jurafsky et al., advanced textbook





### Blogs
 - There're lots of interesting blogs on Medium.com(application of ML architectures), Analytics Vidhya(Data Mining), Victor Cheng(Consulting) and our [blog](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/alpha-nebula) on Zhihu.com(on quantitative trading).


### Online Course
 - [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), by deeplearning.ai on Coursera, provide useful resources on Deep Learning, with instances on CV and NLP, very friendly for rookies.
